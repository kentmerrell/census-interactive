This is a exploratory look at adding interactive multidimensional visualizations to CEDSCI.

Investigate viability of providing multi-dimensional interactive visualizations. Initial test scenario consists of the following steps.
1) User selects geography A (Davis County, Utah) and geography B (Salt Lake City, Utah)
2) Application displays 5-year frequency chart for total populations of each geography
3) User selects a dimensional variable (age buckets) 
4) User interactively selects which values of the dimensional variable to include in frequency chart.
 
I think we have a great opportunity to provide something that provides a meaningful view of the data and does not already exist in other census tools.
